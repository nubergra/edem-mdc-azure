# Azure Processing - Exercise 1: Create an Azure Function

## **Objective**  

In this exercise, we will create a simple **Azure Function** using the **Azure Portal**. We will trigger the function within the portal to understand how Azure Functions work. The first part of this exercise will be a **guided exercise** led by the instructor.  

## **Steps**  

1. **Create an Azure Function App** using the **Azure Portal**. Azure Function App is the **hosting environment for one or more Azure Functions**.
2. From the **environment of your choosing**, create a simple function (e.g., an HTTP-triggered function) and deploy it to the Azure Function App.  
3. From the Portal, **run the function** and **view the execution results** in the logs.  
4. Once you are done with the exercise, **delete** the created resources.
