## **Objective**  

In this exercise, we will deploy an **Azure Container App** using the previously created container.

The first two steps of the exercise will be a **guided exercise** led by the instructor.

## **Steps**  

1. **Deploy a container app** using the **Azure Portal** with the previously created container.  
2. **Delete the container app** to start fresh.  
3. **Use Terraform to deploy the container app** using the image from **Azure Container Registry**.
