# EDEM - Master Big Data and Cloud - Azure Cloud

Welcome to the **Azure Cloud** exercises repository for the EDEM Master in Big Data and Cloud program. This repository contains hands-on exercises designed to help you understand and work with Microsoft Azure's core services, with a focus on **data-related services**.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll gain core knowledge of [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?msockid=031b26ad269166ac0a58327e2796675a), learning how to set up and utilize its key services. The course is structured into several sessions, each covering essential concepts and practical exercises.

### Course Sessions

1. **Set Up ‚öôÔ∏è**  
   - Learn how to set up the Azure Portal to start creating cloud services.
   - Explore the portal UI, Azure CLI, and cost management.

2. **Storage üíæ**  
   - Understand the primary data storage services in Azure.

3. **Processing ‚ö°**  
   - Explore Azure's main data processing services.

4. **End-to-End Project üèóÔ∏è**  
   - Apply concepts from previous sessions to build a complete data pipeline using Azure services.

Each session includes guided exercises with instructions and useful references. Some sections also provide optional extra exercises for additional practice.
